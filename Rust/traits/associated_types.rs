// associated types connect a type placeholder with a trait such that the trait method definitions can use
// these placeholder types in their signatures
// the implementer of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the placeholder type for
// the particular implementation
// associated types also become part of the traitâ€™s contract: implementers of the trait must provide a type to stand
// in for the associated type placeholder
// associated types often have a name that describes how the type will be used, and documenting the associated type
// in the API documentation is good practice

// here Item is an associated type

// if we were to use generics, we would have to annotate the types in each implementation
// with associated types, we do not need to annotate types because we cannot implement a trait on a type multiple times
// pub trait Iterator<T> {
