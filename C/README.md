Compile
-------
To compile a C program using the `gcc` command, run:
```
gcc file.c
```
this will create an executable file `a.out` in the current directory.

To specify an output file name and/or location for the executable, use the `-o` option nad run:
```
gcc -o output/path/file_name file.c
```
e.g. to compile a `hello_world.c` source file into a `bin` directory with more useful name than `a.out`, run:
```
gcc -o ./bin/hello_world hello_world.c
```
> Note: A path is not required however a file name is. If a path is used, `gcc` will not create given directories, they must already exist.

Other options can be passed to the `gcc` command other than just `-o`, for example, using `-Wall` will display all warnings generated by the program being compiled. An example use:
```
gcc -Wall -o file file.c
```

Run
---
To run a compiled C program in the terminal, run:
```
path/to/compiled_file_name
```
e.g. if no `-o` option was used when compiling the program, run:
```
./a.out
```
If the `-o` option was used, e.g. the compiled file is called `hello_world` and the file was compiled into the current directory, run:
```
./hello_world
```
If a path was also provided during compilation e.g. the option `-o ./bin/hello_world` was used, then either navigate to the directory containing the executable, run:
```
cd ./bin
./hello_world
```
or include the path in the executed command, run:
```
./bin/hello_wold
```
